# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Summary
In this lab, we dove deeper into using verilog to implement digital logic. This lab was different because we had to design the top.v file and build each of the circuits. We were able to build a more complex circuit by using the output of one circuit as an input to the other. In this lab we learned how to build these more complex circuits within verilog, applying what we learned in class to build this circuit based on the truth table.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
The Top Level file contains the implementation of the connection of the two circuits. The main module holds the declaration of the inputs and outputs for each circuit- assigning switches and leds.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
