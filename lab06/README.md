## Lab Summary

In this lab, we applied our knowledge of adding and number theory to implement a two bit adder in vivado.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - How might you add more than two bits together?

### 2 - What is the importance of the XOR gate in an adder?

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?

The largest possible output a two bit adder can handle is 7. This is because the largest number two bits can be is 3, 3+3=6. However, we also have a carry in for the two bit adder, meaning it is actually 3+3+1=7. Therefore, the largest possible number it can handle is 7. If it goes over this number, it is an overflow and the computer is unable to store that data.
